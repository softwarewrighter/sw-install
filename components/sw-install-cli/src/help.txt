sw-install: Binary Installer for softwarewrighter CLI Projects

OVERVIEW:
  This tool installs compiled Rust binaries from local Cargo projects into
  ~/.local/softwarewrighter/bin/, making them accessible from your PATH.

USAGE MODES:

  1. Setup installation directory (first-time use):
     sw-install --setup-install-dir

  2. Install a binary:
     sw-install -p <project-path> [OPTIONS]

  3. List installed binaries:
     sw-install --list

  4. Uninstall a binary:
     sw-install -u <binary-name> [OPTIONS]

EXAMPLES:

  First-time setup:
    sw-install --setup-install-dir
    source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

  Install a release binary:
    sw-install -p ~/projects/ask

  Install with a different name:
    sw-install -p ~/projects/ask -r ask-dev

  Install debug build:
    sw-install -p ~/projects/ask --type debug

  Preview installation (dry-run):
    sw-install -p ~/projects/ask -n -v

  List installed binaries:
    sw-install --list

  List with sorting options:
    sw-install --list --sort name     # Sort alphabetically (default)
    sw-install --list --sort newest   # Show newest first
    sw-install --list --sort oldest   # Show oldest first

  Uninstall a binary:
    sw-install -u ask

  Uninstall with preview:
    sw-install -u ask -n -v

PREREQUISITES:
  - Run 'sw-install --setup-install-dir' for first-time setup
  - Project must have a Cargo.toml file
  - Binary must be compiled (run 'cargo build --release' or 'cargo build')

WORKSPACE SUPPORT:
  sw-install automatically detects three project structures:

  1. Simple project: Single Cargo.toml with [package]
  2. Workspace project: Cargo.toml with [workspace] and members
  3. Multi-component project: No root Cargo.toml, components/<name>/Cargo.toml

  For workspaces with multiple binary crates, it will list all found binaries
  and install the first one (use --rename to specify a different name).

AI CODING AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
  This tool is designed for automated binary installation in development
  workflows. Key features for automation:

  1. INSTALLATION WORKFLOW:
     - Run: sw-install -p /path/to/project
     - For debug builds: sw-install -p /path/to/project --type debug
     - For renamed binaries: sw-install -p /path/to/project -r new-name
     - Preview first: sw-install -p /path/to/project --dry-run -v

  2. LISTING BINARIES:
     - Run: sw-install --list
     - Returns sorted list of all installed binaries with timestamps
     - Use --verbose for detailed output
     - Sort options: --sort name (default), --sort newest, --sort oldest

  3. UNINSTALLATION WORKFLOW:
     - Run: sw-install -u binary-name
     - Preview first: sw-install -u binary-name --dry-run -v
     - Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = error

  4. FIRST-TIME SETUP:
     - Run: sw-install --setup-install-dir
     - Creates installation directory
     - Configures PATH in shell config
     - User must reload shell after setup

  5. ERROR HANDLING:
     - Exit code 0 = success
     - Non-zero exit code = error occurred
     - All errors include actionable suggestions
     - Check stderr for error messages

  6. BEST PRACTICES:
     - Use --dry-run (-n) to preview actions before execution
     - Use --verbose (-v) to see detailed step-by-step output
     - Combine flags: -nvp for verbose dry-run installation
     - All file paths are validated before operations
     - Safe to run in automated environments

ERROR HANDLING:
  - Missing project: 'Project path does not exist'
  - Missing Cargo.toml: 'Cargo.toml not found in project'
  - Binary not built: 'Source binary not found' (suggests running cargo build)
  - Permission errors: Reports specific file/directory issues

SECURITY:
  - Operates only in user-owned directories
  - No privilege escalation required
  - Validates all paths to prevent traversal attacks
  - Safe to run in automated environments
